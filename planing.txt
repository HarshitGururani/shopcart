🧭 What to Build First?
✅ Start with the backend.

Why?
The backend defines the data structure (products, users, orders).

It gives you real API endpoints for your frontend to connect to.

You'll avoid building a frontend that needs to be later adjusted to backend limitations.

🛠 Recommended Build Order
✅ Phase 1: Backend Setup (1–3 days)
Initialize backend

Express app with server.js

Connect MongoDB Atlas

Use .env for secrets

Create Models

User (admin only)

Product (with categories, images, stock, etc.)

Implement Auth

JWT login for admin

POST /api/admin/login

Product Routes

POST /api/products → Add

PUT /api/products/:id → Update

DELETE /api/products/:id → Delete

GET /api/products → Public listing

GET /api/products/:id → Product detail

Integrate Cloudinary

For uploading product images

Test with Postman

Verify your backend is solid before moving on

✅ Phase 2: Admin Panel (2–3 days)
Set up Next.js app (admin-dashboard/)

Implement Admin Login Page

Build Product Management UI

Add Product (image + form)

Product List Table (edit/delete)

Secure routes using local storage/JWT

Use backend APIs (from Phase 1)

✅ Phase 3: Frontend Storefront (3–4 days)
